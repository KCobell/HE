# To do:
# Finish off playergen and worldgen modules
# Gameplay: water, unit tiers, releasing nations, choosing a starting nation
# Camera: rotating, better camera boundary calculation
# Art: sprites, sounds, music, gradual fade-in of locality names
# Multiplayer
# Map editor
# Campaign mode
# UI: game menu, settings menu
# Settings: map dimensions, map generation (bug: starting positions can overwrite one another), map seeds, player generation, colors
# Alternative ruleset: fog of war, border expansion
# AI: more efficient, more skilled
# Spinoff idea: encircling enemy armies liquidates them. Cutting an army off from supply lines (cities) drains manpower. New mobile units. Terrain defense modifiers. Semi-automatic railroad transport system.

# Bugs:
# sort out alpha blending (most likely not possible in sld.gfx - will need to switch to openGL eventually)
# zooming in clips locality names

# Code quality:
# cubic.Cube as a dataclass?
# type hinting
# docstrings
# 140 pylint issues left to resolve

# Done:
# Improved AI,Â but very inefficient
# Added some docstrings
# Many pylint code quality issues solved
# Merged Game and World classes into one Game class
# Rewrote the click_on_tile Player method
# Transformed regular classes into dataclasses where appropriate
# Player armies are now trained immediatly after the player's turn ends.
# Drawing is now only performed on pixels within camera range (mostly)
# Rendering rate decoupled from the tick rate (to some extent)
# Playergen module which generates players with randomly assigned colors.
# bugfix: negative morale by applying idle army penalty
# bugfix: double turns after defeating a player
# bugfix: stuck legal move indicator
# bugfix: negative morale
# bugfix: zooming could set layout.size to (0,0), causing division by zero error
# bugfix: extending borders now works every time (this bug was caused by a reverse dict lookup)
# bugfix: a rounding error allowing a 0/0 army to persist
# bugfix: floating point morale for some units after applying losing battle morale penalty
# bugfix: morale could surpass max value due to faulty 'minimum morale per 50 manpower' implementation
